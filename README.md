# Tourism Management System
A Java project showcasing clean OOP design through a real-world tour booking system. Built with scalability, validation, and business logic in mind.

## Key Highlights
- 4 OOP pillars: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

### One abstract class TourBooking with 4 concrete subclasses:

- LocalIndividualBooking

- LocalGroupBooking

- InternationalIndividualBooking

- InternationalGroupBooking

## Smart validations:

- Age, nationality, passport check, group size, travel dates, weekdays-only booking

- Discount rules for Rwandans (5%) & East Africans (4%)

- USD to RWF conversion + international tax handling
